>“Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.”
— Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes

> “We teach best what we most need to learn.” ― Richard Bach

The two big ideas the motivate this blog:

1. Writing facilitates thinking. Without writing, we have no way to determine whether our ideas or thoughts are coherent. Without putting our thoughts on paper, we have no means to organize our ideas and make and keep the connections. This site is a place to store thoughts, research, projects, and ideas.
2. Research is about gaining insight and sharing that insight publicly.

Research provides you with new ideas that need to be connected, placed into context, to eventually produce insight. The research needs to be shared, so that is relevant, valuable, and truthful.

The hope is to create content, share it, get feedback, and improve.
