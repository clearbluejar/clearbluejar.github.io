>* A Trace is basically a collection of observations of memory and registers over the lifetime of an
>* application or computer system. In Ghidra, the Trace object also supports many of the same
>* annotations as does Program. In the same way that Program brings knowledge markup to an image of
>* bytes, Trace brings knowledge markup to bytes observed over time.
