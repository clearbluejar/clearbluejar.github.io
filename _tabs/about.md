>“Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.”
— Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes

> “We teach best what we most need to learn.” ― Richard Bach

Writing facilitates thinking. Without writing, we have no way to determine whether our ideas or thoughts are coherent. Without putting our thoughts on paper, we have no means to organize our ideas and make and keep the connections. This site is a place to store thoughts, research, projects, and ideas.

The hope is to create technical content, share it, get feedback, and improve.
